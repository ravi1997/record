## Data Synchronization

### How Synchronization Works

The Medical Record System uses an offline-first approach:

1. All data is stored locally on your device
2. Changes are marked as "pending sync"
3. When connected to the internet, pending changes are automatically synchronized
4. Conflicts are resolved according to predefined rules
5. Successful sync updates the local record status

### Manual Sync

To manually trigger synchronization:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard or Settings
2. Tap "Sync Now" or similar option
3. View sync progress in the notification area
4. Review sync results when complete

### Sync Status Indicators

Records display sync status with these indicators:

- **Green Checkmark**: Successfully synced with server
- **Orange Clock**: Pending synchronization
- **Red Warning**: Sync error (requires attention)
- **Gray Dash**: New record not yet saved locally

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur during sync:

1. The system attempts automatic resolution based on timestamps
2. If automatic resolution isn't possible, you'll be prompted to choose
3. Conflicts are logged for audit purposes
4. Administrators can review conflict resolution history

### Bandwidth Considerations

To minimize bandwidth usage:

1. Compress files before uploading where possible
2. Sync during off-peak hours
3. Use WiFi when available
4. Monitor sync progress in the status bar
