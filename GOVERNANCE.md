# Project Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance structure, roles, and processes for the Medical Record System project. It establishes how decisions are made, how contributors are organized, and how the project evolves over time.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Lead
The Project Lead is responsible for:
- Setting overall project direction and vision
- Making final decisions on technical and architectural choices
- Managing relationships with stakeholders and partners
- Ensuring the project aligns with its mission and values
- Representing the project in public forums and conferences

### Core Maintainers
Core Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and approving pull requests
- Managing releases and versioning
- Responding to critical issues and security vulnerabilities
- Mentoring new contributors and guiding their contributions
- Participating in strategic planning discussions

### Contributors
Contributors are individuals who:
- Submit code changes via pull requests
- Report bugs and suggest enhancements
- Improve documentation
- Participate in community discussions
- Help with testing and quality assurance

### Community Members
Community Members are users who:
- Use the software and provide feedback
- Participate in discussions and forums
- Promote the project to others
- Attend project events and presentations

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Based Approach
Most decisions are made through a consensus-building process:
1. Proposals are discussed openly in GitHub issues or discussions
2. Feedback is gathered from the community
3. Concerns are addressed through discussion
4. A decision is made when there is broad agreement

### Voting Process
When consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made through voting:
- Core Maintainers: 1 vote each
- Project Lead: 2 votes (casting vote in case of ties)
- Contributors: No formal voting rights but encouraged to participate in discussions

Proposals requiring a vote:
- Major architectural changes
- Breaking changes to the API
- Adoption of new technologies or frameworks
- Changes to governance structure

### Emergency Decisions
In emergency situations (security vulnerabilities, critical bugs):
- Project Lead or designated Core Maintainer can make immediate decisions
- Emergency decisions must be communicated to the community within 24 hours
- A retrospective review is conducted after the emergency has passed

## Release Management

### Versioning
The project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backward-compatible functionality
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Cadence
Regular releases occur on a quarterly basis, with:
- Minor releases approximately every 3 months
- Patch releases as needed for critical fixes
- Major releases as determined by roadmap and planning

### Release Process
1. Feature freeze announced 2 weeks before release
2. Testing period with community participation
3. Final review and approval by Core Maintainers
4. Release tagged and published
5. Release notes distributed to community

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements
All code changes must:
- Pass automated tests and linting checks
- Include appropriate documentation updates
- Have at least one Core Maintainer approval
- Follow established coding standards

### Review Timeline
- Standard PRs: Reviewed within 5 business days
- Urgent PRs: Prioritized for faster review
- Large features: May require multiple review cycles

### Review Criteria
Reviewers evaluate submissions based on:
- Correctness and efficiency of implementation
- Adherence to coding standards and best practices
- Adequacy of tests and documentation
- Impact on existing functionality
- Security considerations

## Community Engagement
