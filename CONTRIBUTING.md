1. A clear and descriptive title
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Screenshots or code examples if applicable
5. Environment details (OS, browser, version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome! To suggest an enhancement:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Provide a clear description of the proposed feature
3. Explain the problem it solves or value it adds
4. Include any relevant examples or mockups
5. Consider potential implementation approaches

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-record-system.git`
3. Create a branch for your feature or bugfix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
6. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Create a pull request

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards
2. Write clear, concise commit messages
3. Include tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Reference any related issues in your PR description
6. Request review from maintainers

#### Coding Standards

##### Dart/Flutter Standards
- Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Comment complex logic and public APIs
- Use Flutter's built-in linting rules (`flutter analyze`)

##### Python/Flask Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- Keep functions and classes focused and testable
- Use meaningful variable names

##### General Principles
- Write self-documenting code
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Prefer immutable data structures when possible
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs

#### Testing Requirements

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Widget Tests**: Verify UI component behavior
3. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
4. **Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and boundary values

Run tests with:
```bash
# Flutter tests
flutter test

# Backend tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

#### Documentation Updates

When making changes that affect functionality:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add docstrings to new functions and classes
3. Update README.md if introducing new features
4. Modify inline comments for complex logic

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Install Flutter SDK (3.10 or higher)
2. Install Python 3.8+
3. Clone the repository
4. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get` and `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
5. Run the backend: `cd backend && python app.py`
6. Run the app: `flutter run`

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `feature/new-feature-name` for new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` for bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` for urgent fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` for documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` for refactoring work

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commit messages:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed description of the changes.
Include any relevant issue numbers or references.

Fixes #123
Closes #456
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Code Review Process

All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one maintainer before merging:

1. Automated checks must pass (tests, linting)
2. Code review focuses on:
   - Correctness and efficiency
   - Readability and maintainability
   - Security considerations
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates
3. Address all review comments
4. Squash commits if requested
5. Maintainers will merge once approved
